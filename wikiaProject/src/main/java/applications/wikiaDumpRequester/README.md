Please note that this program part does not work since Wikia changed the dump request policy.
Currently, only administrators of a wiki can request new dumps.

This part of the program requested new dumps from wikia for all wikis (also those for which there is no dump available).
In case the policy change is reversed you can check whether the program works again.
